    <h1>Programming an Arduino board - Real-time Motor Speed Control with Arduino and L9110</h1>
    <h2>Materials and Components</h2>
<p>Using the below, the objective was to create a system that allows for the real-time adjustment of a motor's speed. This necessitated the use of a potentiometer as an analog input and translating its readings into a pulse-width modulated (PWM) output to control the motor driver.</p>
 <p>•	Arduino Uno: central microcontroller unit</p>
 <p>•	L9110 Motor Driver: This module controls the motor's speed and direction</p>
 <p>•	Potentiometer: an analog device used to provide variable voltage to the Arduino (10k ohm)</p>
 <p>•	Breadboard: used for making an easy and solderless prototype of the circuit</p>
 <p>•	Jumper Wires: wires that connect the components together, facilitating communication and power transfer</p>
 <p>•	Motor (compatible with the L9110 driver): final output device which is controlled by the L9110 driver via the Arduino</p>

<h2>Circuit Assembly</h2>
<p>Initially, the direct connection of the Arduino to the L9110 driver with a minimalistic setup seemed straightforward. However, the simplicity was deceptive, as the motor refused to stir.</p> 
<p>The initial failure of the motor to respond led to a series of troubleshooting steps:</p>
<p>•	Verifying the motor driver and motor functionality independently.</p>
<p>•	Inspecting connections for potential shorts or breaks.</p>
<p>•	Researching common pitfalls in similar setups.</p>
<p>Thanks to Bobby's insight during open lab, it became clear that the potentiometer required a stable configuration that the breadboard facilitated through its organized rows and connection points. As such, I incorporated the breadboard and rerouted the wiring. The potentiometer's terminals received a dedicated space on the breadboard, and jumper wires formed structured pathways to the L9110. This orderly setup highlighted the importance of clean and precise connections in electronic projects.</p>

<h2>Code</h2>
<p>•	analogRead(potPin): Reads the analog voltage (0-5V) from the potentiometer, producing a 10-bit value (0-1023).</p>
<p>•	map(potValue, 0, 1023, 0, 255): This translates the 10-bit potentiometer value into an 8-bit value that the PWM output can utilize. The mapping is linear, where turning the potentiometer increases or decreases the voltage linearly, thus providing a smooth transition of speed control.</p>
<p>•	analogWrite(A1A, motorSpeed): Sends the PWM signal to the motor driver, where the "duty cycle" reflects the potentiometer's position, effectively controlling the motor speed.</p>
<p>•	delay(10): A short delay to ensure the stability of the system, preventing it from reacting to noise or rapid, unintended changes.</p>
