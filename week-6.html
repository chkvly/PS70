    <h1>Capacitive Sensing and Photoresistance</h1>
    <h2>Part 1: Capacitive Sensor with Foil Touchpad</h2>
<p>The goal was to create a capacitive sensor that can detect touch. When the foil touchpad is touched, an LED light is programmed to turn on.</p>

<h2>Method</h2>
<p>Using an ELEGOO Uno R3, I constructed a capacitive sensor with a simple foil touchpad. The sensor was connected to the microcontroller, which was set up to light up an LED upon sensing touch.</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>To avoid the delay() function, I utilized timers to continuously check the state of the capacitive sensor. When a touch was detected, the timer would trigger the LED to light up.</p>

  

<p>I began with the spline tool in Fusion 360, which allows for the creation of complex and smooth curves based on control points. This tool was instrumental in outlining the initial contours of the phone stand. The ability to adjust the tension and curvature through these points provided the freedom to experiment with different shapes, ensuring that the stand's cradle would be suited for an iPhone’s dimensions.</p>
<p>The extrude function was used iteratively to transform the two-dimensional spline sketches into a three-dimensional object. This was a trial-and-error process, as each extrusion helped to reveal aspects of the design that needed refinement. Adjustments were periodically made to the depth and angles of the extrusion. To further refine the design, I used tapered angles to create smooth edges that provide more elegance to the stand without introducing risk of slipping.</p>

  <h2>3D Printing Process - Equipment and Materials</h2>
<p>•	Printer: Original Prusa i3 MK3S (the print commenced with a heated bed to ensure optimal adhesion and a controlled print environment to mitigate warping)</p>
<p>•	Material: PLA (given its low shrinkage properties)</p>
<p>•	Layer Height: 0.2 mm</p>
<p>•	Infill: 20%</p>

<h2>Final Product</h2>
<p>The completion of the 2-hour and 9-minute print culminated in a phone stand that was both functional and aesthetically pleasing!</p>
