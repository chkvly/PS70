    <h1>Capacitive Sensing and Photoresistance</h1>
    <h2>Part 1: Capacitive Sensor with Foil Touchpad</h2>
    
<p>Using an ELEGOO Uno R3, I constructed a capacitive sensor with a simple foil touchpad. This conductive material, inexpensive and easily available, proved to be an excellent surface for detecting capacitive changes caused by a human finger. The foil's sizable surface area ensured that even light touches could be registered effectively. The sensor was connected to the microcontroller, which was set up to light up an LED upon sensing touch.</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>To avoid the delay() function, I utilized timers to continuously check the state of the capacitive sensor. When a touch was detected, the timer would trigger the LED to light up. I used the 'CapacitiveSensor' library to convert the microcontroller's digital pin into a capacitive sensor. This library facilitated the detection of the subtle changes in the electromagnetic field around the foil.</p>

<h2>Serial Plotter Analysis of Capacitive Foil Sensor</h2>
    <p>I used the Arduino IDE's serial plotter to visualize the capacitive sensor's output in real-time.</p>

    <p>•	Data Range: The values seem to fluctuate between approximately 100 and 250.</p>
<p>•	Pattern: The plot shows a somewhat erratic pattern, indicating that the sensor is picking up a variety of capacitance changes. These could correspond to different touch intensities, duration, or possibly environmental factors affecting the sensor.</p>
<p>•	Frequency: There are frequent peaks and troughs, suggesting a responsive sensor to continuous or regular interaction.</p>

<p>•	Data Range: The values exhibit a wider range, dipping below 0 and peaking around 1,200.</p>
<p>•	Pattern: The plot demonstrates a pattern of sharp spikes at regular intervals, followed by quick returns to the baseline. This could indicate a designed interaction, like a deliberate touch or tap.</p>
<p>•	Frequency: The consistent pattern of high peaks suggests a controlled test of the sensor, perhaps simulating a user engaging with the sensor at regular intervals.</p>
   
    
<h2>Part 2: Photoresistor</h2>
<p>For the second part of the assignment, I made a photoresistor to control the same LED. Specifically, the LED turns off when a certain brightness level is detected.</p>

    <h2>Implementation</h2>
    <p>A photoresistor was incorporated into the existing circuit on the breadboard. This component changes its resistance based on the intensity of light falling upon it. The lower the light level, the higher the resistance; conversely, bright light yields lower resistance.</p>
<p>Specifically, the photoresistor was placed in series with a fixed resistor. This arrangement allowed the Arduino to measure the voltage at the junction between the resistors, which became an indicator of the light intensity.</p>

<h2>Calibration</h2>
<p>To observe the relationship between the signals recorded by the microcontroller and the physical quantities being measured, I calibrated the photoresistor using an iPhone flashlight with four brightness settings and found that the LED turns off at the third brightness setting.</p>
