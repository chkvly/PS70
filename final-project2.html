    <h1>Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Overview</h1>

    <h2>MVP Features</h2>
    <ul>
                <li><strong>ESP32 Integration:</strong> An ESP32 microcontroller is employed to control the interaction between the hardware and the serverless database, handling data collection and transmission efficiently. In the below image, four push-buttons are wired to the microcontroller's designated input pins, and each is debounced in Arduino to avoid erroneous signals caused by mechanical bounce.</li>
            <li><strong>Serverless Database (Firebase):</strong> Google's Firebase is utilized as the backend to store real-time data on seat status (available, filled, pending), leveraging its scalability, ease of setup, and real-time data synchronization features.</li>
        <li><strong>Front-End Webpage:</strong> A dedicated webpage serves as the user interface, displaying available seats in real-time. The design is responsive, ensuring accessibility across various devices and screen sizes.</li>
        <li><strong>Simple User Interface:</strong> A straightforward and minimalistic user interface is used in the MVP to facilitate ease of use and understanding.</li>

    </ul>

        <p>For a direct look at the MVP in action, refer to the video here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/CJR1PhTzQB8">YouTube MVP Demonstration</a>.</p>

    <h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
    <p>Based on the feedback and observations from the MVP demo, several enhancements are planned to refine the functionality, user experience, and performance for the final product, including: incorporating a motion sensor to detect if a seat is occupied, creating a more dynamic bidding system, and potentially creating an iPhone mock-up of the bidding interface.</p>
