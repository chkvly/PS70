    <h1>Custom 3D-Printed Phone Stand Project</h1>
    <h2>Design Inspiration</h2>
<p>My goal was to design a practical yet aesthetically pleasing phone stand. The stand should not only to provide stability and support for a smartphone but also to ensure ease of interaction, whether it be for video calling, media consumption, or as a desk accessory that complements the modern workspace.</p>

<h2>Conceptualization and Modeling</h2>
<p>Using CAD software, the phone stand was conceptualized with user ergonomics in mind. The design features a minimalist curve, catering to the form factor of contemporary smartphones while ensuring a robust base for stability. The process involved iterative modifications to achieve the perfect balance between form and function.</p>

  <h2>3D Printing Process - Equipment and Materials</h2>
<p>•	Printer: Original Prusa i3 MK3S (the print commenced with a heated bed to ensure optimal adhesion and a controlled print environment to mitigate warping)</p>
<p>•	Material: PLA (given its low shrinkage properties)</p>
<p>•	Layer Height: 0.2 mm</p>
<p>•	Infill: 20%</p>

<h2>Final Product</h2>
<p>The completion of the 2-hour and 9-minute print culminated in a phone stand that was both functional and aesthetically pleasing!</p>
