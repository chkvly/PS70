    <h1>Final Project Proposal: <strong>A Real-Time Seat Bidding Mechanism to Address the Extreme Inefficiency of Underutilized Seating at the US Open via SIM7600 Microcontrollers and QR Codes</strong></h1>
    <p>This project proposes a dynamic and user-centred technological solution to a common problem faced at the US Open tennis tournament, paving the way for a more engaging, satisfying, and dynamic event experience for fans, while simultaneously offering tangible benefits for tournament organizers in terms of revenue and data insights.</p>
</div>

<div class="fade-section">
    <strong>The Core Components:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>QR Code Integration:</strong> Each seat is equipped with a unique QR code, affixed in a visible location, such as the seat back or armrest. This QR code serves as the digital identifier for the seat, linking it to the event's seating database.</li>
        <li><strong>SIM7600 Microcontrollers:</strong> The system utilizes SIM7600 microcontrollers for their LTE capabilities, low cost, and versatility. These microcontrollers are connected to a central server and manage the real-time data transmission of seat availability and user interactions. When a seat becomes available, the device sends a signal via the SIM7600 module to the event's central server, updating the seat's status in the system. This information is then pushed to the mobile application or website where fans can view available seats and make bids or requests for seat upgrades.</li>
        <li><strong>User Registration and Notification System:</strong> Fans interested in upgrading their seats can register for notifications through a dedicated mobile application or website. This platform allows them to set preferences for seat locations, price ranges, and timing. Fans that match the criteria for available seats (based on their preferences set in the app) receive alerts through SMS or app notifications, facilitated by the SIM7600's ability to interact with the cellular network for sending SMS directly or through internet data for app notifications.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="fade-section">
    <strong>The Process Flow:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Seat Vacancy Declaration:</strong> When a ticket holder decides to leave their seat for more than an hour, they scan the QR code using their smartphone. This action prompts them to confirm their departure time and the expected duration of vacancy.</li>
        <li><strong>Real-Time Seat Availability Update:</strong> Upon confirmation, the SIM7600 microcontroller communicates with the central server, updating the seat's status to "available" and triggering the notification system.</li>
        <li><strong>Notification and Bidding:</strong> Registered fans receive instant notifications about the available seat. They can view details about the seat location, expected availability duration, and start bidding if the option is available. The bidding process can be designed to be time-sensitive, ensuring a quick turnover and maximizing seat utilization.</li>
        <li><strong>Seat Allocation:</strong> Once a bid is accepted, or a fan claims the seat through a first-come, first-served process, they receive a digital pass or QR code, granting them access to the seat for the specified duration.</li>
        <li><strong>Feedback and Iteration:</strong> Fans provide feedback on their experience, which is analyzed to continuously improve the system. This iterative process is fundamental to design thinking, ensuring the solution remains user-focused and adapts to changing needs and technologies.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="fade-section">
    <p><strong>For Fans:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Improved Access to Prime Seats:</strong> Fans have the opportunity to upgrade to better seats that would otherwise remain empty, enhancing their viewing experience and overall enjoyment of the event.</li>
        <li><strong>Cost-Effective Experience:</strong> This system could offer fans access to premium seats at a potentially lower cost than purchasing them outright, making the event more accessible and enjoyable for a wider audience.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhanced Engagement:</strong> The excitement of bidding for seat upgrades or receiving notifications about available prime seats adds an interactive layer to the event experience, keeping fans engaged and connected.</li>
        <li><strong>Flexibility and Convenience:</strong> Fans can spontaneously decide to upgrade their seats during the event, adding a level of flexibility and personalization to their experience.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="fade-section">
    <p><strong>For Tournament Organizers:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Increased Revenue:</strong> By selling access to seats that would otherwise be empty, organizers can generate additional revenue with a dynamic pricing model based on demand, time, and seat location, optimizing revenue potential.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhanced Reputation:</strong> Implementing innovative solutions that prioritize fan experience positions the tournament as a leader in customer engagement and technology use, potentially attracting more attendees and sponsors.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Collection and Insights:</strong> The system provides valuable data on fan behavior, preferences, and seating patterns. This data can inform future marketing strategies, event planning, and pricing models, leading to more informed decisions and improved event management.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="fade-section">
    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
    <p>This system not only maximizes the utilization of seating but also enhances the fan experience by offering spontaneous seat upgrades. It would be collaborative through fan interaction and experimental through real-time feedback and iteration.</p>
