    <h1>CNC and Vacuum Forming Fabrication of a Cat Tray</h1>
    <h2>Design and Planning</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Design Inspiration and Digital Tracing:</strong> A photo of Winston, the cat, was used to digitally trace and create a file compatible with CNC machining, ensuring the final tray reflected Winstonâ€™s silhouette.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>CNC Machining</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Plywood was accurately cut using a CNC machine. Initial inaccuracies required a second machining pass to achieve perfect mold edges for the vacuum forming process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Vacuum Forming</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A plastic sheet was heated and then vacuum-formed over the CNC-cut plywood to create a detailed and durable mold. This mold captured all the nuances of the design, allowing for high-quality plaster casting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Casting</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The detailed plastic mold was prepared and plaster mixed with purple dye was poured in, ensuring consistency in the marbled effect by carefully stirring to prevent air bubbles.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Demolding and Finishing</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Once the plaster set, the piece was demolded. Any imperfections were sanded, and edges smoothed.</li>
        <li>A coat of Rust-Oleum Triple Thick Glaze was applied for a glossy finish and added protection.</li>
    </ul>
